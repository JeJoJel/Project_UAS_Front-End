                    <p>
                        Before I became a mom, I wore my hair down most days, 
                        and I honestly didn't use or own very many hair accessories 
                        other than a few headbands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now that I need my hair pulled up most of the time, 
                        so my son doesn't pull it (lol), I have became a bit of a claw clip hoarder. 
                        I now own lots of claw clips, headbands, and barrettes, 
                        and I was wanting to organize them a bit more than just sitting out 
                        on my bathroom shelf (or loose in a basket under my sink).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that was the inspiration behind this hair accessories organizer DIY.

                <div class="section" id="section1">
                    <h2>How do you organize hair accessories?</h2> 
                    <p>
                        I like a solution where they are easy to see (so I don't forget what I own), 
                        easy to grab when I want to use them, but also arranged in a way that is visually appealing. 
                        I don't want to lose track of what I have or feel like I'm digging around just to find 
                        the claw clip I'm looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I also wanted the organizer to be simple and feel like decor in my space. 
                        Function and beauty was the aim.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <!-- Section 2 - Supplies -->
                <div class="section" id="section2">
                    <h2>About the Supplies</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We need:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>wicker rounds</li>
                        <li>yarn</li>
                        <li>fabric (leather or felt)</li>
                        <li>fabric scissors</li>
                        <li>glue</li>
                        <li>Command strip hooks or nails for hanging</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The wicker rounds are sometimes sold as wall decor, 
                        and sometimes as a kitchen item (like for holding fruit). 
                        I've linked mine above, but if you thrift, I would definitely check there too 
                        as I often see this kind of item when I'm thrifting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, I used some scrap black leather that I've had in my fabric stash forever. 
                        I've used it on so many projects, lol. But you don't have to use leather, 
                        you just need something thick that a claw clip could hold on to. 
                        You could also use all yarn instead if you like.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Plan where your items will go. I planned to have the claw clips clipped onto yarn and leather pieces, 
                            and the headbands and barrettes would be held by longer leather pieces that hang down.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add the felt and fabric as needed.</li>

                        <li>
                            Last minute, I decided to glue on a few geometric pieces just for aesthetics. 
                            Other ideas for decorating these: tassels, other fabric shapes, sewing yarn along the outer rims, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I used Command hooks to hang these on the back of my bathroom door, as it's near the vanity where I get ready in the mornings. 
                            Depending where you hang these you could also use nails instead.
